A package for machine learning inference in FPGAs.  We create firmware implementations of machine learning algorithms using high level synthesis language (HLS). We translate traditional open-source machine learning package models into HLS that can be configured for your use-case!

The project is currently in development, so please let us know if you are interested, your experiences with the package, and if you would like new features to be added.
