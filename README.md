## This project has moved
This branch of the package maintains the state of the BDT translation code used in _[Fast inference of Boosted Decision Trees in FPGAs for particle physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/15/05/P05026)_ (at commit [4e67913](https://github.com/hls-fpga-machine-learning/hls4ml/commit/4e67913eb2b8df05970069414065939e401b95e8))
The project is now maintained under the name 'conifer' at: https://github.com/thesps/conifer

A package for machine learning inference in FPGAs. We create firmware implementations of machine learning algorithms using high level synthesis language (HLS). We translate traditional open-source machine learning package models into HLS that can be configured for your use-case!
