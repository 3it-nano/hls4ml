# Catapult HLS Workspace - DEPRECATED

The experiments continue in a new branch [gdg/mentor.v2](https://github.com/hls-fpga-machine-learning/hls4ml/tree/gdg/mentor.v02/example-prjs/mentor_workspace)

Here you can find some experiments to evaluate the migration to Catapult HLS
from Mentor Graphics.

- `mntr_ex1`: mapping `ap_fixed` to `sc_fixed`
- `mntr_ex2`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor HLS libraries (simulation only)
- `mntr_ex3`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS
