# Catapult HLS Workspace

Here you can find some experiments to evaluate the migration to Catapult HLS
from Mentor Graphics.

- `mntr_ex1`: mapping `ap_fixed` to `sc_fixed`
- `mntr_ex2`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor HLS libraries (simulation only)
- `mntr_ex3`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS
- `mntr_ex4`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS (MNIST Autoencoder)
- `mntr_ex5`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS (MNIST Classifier)
- `mntr_ex6`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS (1 layer)
