# Catapult HLS Workspace

Here you can find some experiments to evaluate the migration to Catapult HLS
from Mentor Graphics.

- :+1: `softmax_catapult_hls`: test your Catapult HLS installation
- :+1: `sigmoid_catapult_hls`: test your Catapult HLS installation
- :lock: ~`mntr_ex1`: mapping `ap_fixed` to `sc_fixed`~
- :lock: ~`mntr_ex2`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor HLS libraries (simulation only)~
- :lock: ~`mntr_ex3`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS~
- :construction_worker: `mntr_ex4`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS (MNIST Autoencoder)
- :construction_worker: `mntr_ex5`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS (MNIST Classifier)
- :+1: `mntr_ex6`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS (1 layer)
- :construction_worker: `mntr_ex7`: porting an *hls4ml* project to Mentor Catapult HLS (3 layer)
- :construction_worker: `mntr_ex8`: testing Mentor [HLSLibs](http://hlslibs.org)
